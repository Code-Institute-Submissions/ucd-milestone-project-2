<h1>User Centric Front-End Development Project</h1>

<p>This project is the first milestone project for the Code Institute. For this project, I chose to do create a website for the band Panic! At The Disco, one of my favourite bands.
My intention was to create a website that was streamlined and easy to follow for existing fans to keep up/interact with the band, and for new, potential fans who want to find out more about the band.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>This website is intended for people who are interested in the band.It allows them to listen to/watch music/videos from the band at their leisure on the website.</p>

<p>My website will allow (potential)fans to listen to and watch content from the band, and allow them to book/request the band to perform for them at an event such as a Christmas party or a wedding.</p>

<h3>User Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a (potential)fan, I want to be able to find out about the band and it's members.</li>
<li>As a (potential)fan, I want to be able to find out about new content when and/or if it is available.</li>
<li>As a (potential)fan, I want to be able to listen to audio clips from the band on their website.</li>
<li>As a (potential)fan, I want to be able to watch (music)videos of the band while on their website.</li>
</ul>

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
